#MuJoCo

MuJoCo stands for Multi-Joint dynamics with Contact. It is a general purpose physics engine that aims to facilitate research and development in robotics, biomechanics, graphics and animation, machine learning, and other areas that demand fast and accurate simulation of articulated structures interacting with their environment. Initially developed by Roboti LLC, it was acquired and made freely available by DeepMind in October 2021, with the goal of making MuJoCo an open-source project.


MuJoCo is a physics engine that aims to facilitate research and development in robotics, biomechanics, graphics and animation, and other areas where fast and accurate simulation is needed.

MuJoCo offers a unique combination of speed, accuracy and modeling power, yet it is not merely a better simulator. Instead it is the first full-featured simulator designed from the ground up for the purpose of model-based optimization, and in particular optimization through contacts.

MuJoCo makes it possible to scale up computationally-intensive techniques such optimal control, physically-consistent state estimation, system identification and automated mechanism design, and apply them to complex dynamical systems in contact-rich behaviors. It also has more traditional applications such as testing and validation of control schemes before deployment on physical robots, interactive scientific visualization, virtual environments, animation and gaming.

The Documentation for MuJoCo is available [here](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html)

##Installation
Let us now follow the following steps to setup MuJoCo on our Linux System
Step 1:  Install anaconda
	`https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2021.11-Linux-x86_64.sh
	sudo chmod +x Anaconda3-2021.11-Linux-x86_64.sh
	./Anaconda3-2021.11-Linux-x86_64.sh`

Step 2 : install git
	`sudo apt install git`

Step 3 : install the mujoco library

1. Download the Mujoco library from [here](https://mujoco.org/download/mujoco210-linux-x86_64.tar.gz)
2. create a hidden folder :
 	`mkdir /home/username/.mujoco`
3. extract the library to the .mujoco folder
4. include these lines in  .bashrc file:
	`export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/tayal/.mujoco/mujoco210/bin
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib/nvidia
	export PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$PATH"
	export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGLEW.so`

5. source .bashrc

6. Test that the library is installed by going into:
 		`cd ~/.mujoco/mujoco210/bin
		./simulate ../model/humanoid.xml`


Step 4 Install mujoco-py:
	`conda create --name mujoco_py python=3.8
	conda activate mujoco_py
	sudo apt update
	sudo apt-get install patchelf
	sudo apt-get install python3-dev build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev libxml2-dev  
	sudo apt-get install libxslt1-dev zlib1g-dev libglew1.5 libglew-dev python3-pip
	git clone https://github.com/openai/mujoco-py
	cd mujoco-py
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	pip install -r requirements.dev.txt
	pip3 install -e . --no-cache`

Step 5 reboot your machine

Step 6 run these commands
	`conda activate mujoco_py
	sudo apt install libosmesa6-dev libgl1-mesa-glx libglfw3
	sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGL.so.1 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libGL.so
	pip3 install -U 'mujoco-py<2.2,>=2.1'
	cd examples
	python3 setting_state.py`
