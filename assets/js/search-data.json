Safe Reinforcement Learning can be defined as the process of learning policies that maximize the expectation of the return in problems in which it is important to ensure reasonable system performance and/or respect safety constraints during the learning and/or deployment processes. .

Specifically, an implementation of SAC + Robust Control Barrier Functions (RCBFs) for safe reinforcement learning in two custom environments. . While exploring, an RL agent can take actions that lead the system to unsafe states. Here, we use a differentiable RCBF safety layer that minimially alters (in the least-squares sense) the actions taken by the RL agent to ensure the safety of the agent. . Robust Control Barrier Functions (RCBFs) . In this work, we focus on RCBFs that are formulated with respect to differential inclusions of the following form: . Here D(x) is a disturbance set unkown apriori to the robot, which we learn online during traing via Gaussian Processes (GPs). The underlying library is GPyTorch. . The QP used to ensure the system’s safety is given by: . . where h(x) is the RCBF, and u_RL is the action outputted by the RL policy.

            "title": "Offline Reinforcement Learning",
            "content": "Offline Reinforcement Learning . Offline reinforcement learning requires reconciling two conflicting aims: learning a policy that improves over the behavior policy that collected the dataset, while at the same time minimizing the deviation from the behavior policy so as to avoid errors due to distributional shift. . . This trade-off is critical, because most current offline reinforcement learning methods need to query the value of unseen actions during training to improve the policy, and therefore need to either constrain these actions to be in-distribution, or else regularize their values. We propose an offline RL method that never needs to evaluate actions outside of the dataset, but still enables the learned policy to improve substantially over the best behavior in the data through generalization. The main insight in our work is that, instead of evaluating unseen actions from the latest policy, we can approximate the policy improvement step implicitly by treating the state value function as a random variable, with randomness determined by the action (while still integrating over the dynamics to avoid excessive optimism), and then taking a state conditional upper expectile of this random variable to estimate the value of the best actions in that state. This leverages the generalization capacity of the function approximator to estimate the value of the best available action at a given state without ever directly querying a Q-function with this unseen action. Our algorithm alternates between fitting this upper expectile value function and backing it up into a Q-function. Then, we extract the policy via advantage-weighted behavioral cloning. We dub our method implicit Q-learning (IQL). IQL demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance on D4RL, a standard benchmark for offline reinforcement learning. We also demonstrate that IQL achieves strong performance fine-tuning using online interaction after offline initialization. .",

            "title": "How to Choose Batteries",
            "content": "Batteries are the energy storage units of many devices that we come across every day; they are available in different forms, sizes, parameters, and shapes. You can commonly find them being used in automotive, Backup power supplies, mobile devices, laptops, iPads, and many other portable electronic devices. But, not all the devices can use the same kind of battery; each and every device has its own specifications and power supply requirements and you will need a battery selection guide to pick the right battery for your application. So in this article will look into the factors to consider while selecting a battery for your next electronic product design. If you are completely news to batteries then it is recommended to read this article on types of batteries and their applications to understand the basics of battery before you proceed further. . Factors for Choosing Batteries . While choosing a battery for your application you must know about the important parameters involved in its operation. The reality about the battery is that there is no common type of battery for all the applications since no battery is perfect. If you want to utilize one parameter of the battery you should be able to handle the depletion of other parameters. For example, if you want your battery to deliver lots of power for your application, the cell internal resistance should be minimized which is only possible by increasing the electrode surface area. This also increases inactive components such as current collectors and conductive aid, so energy density is traded off to gain power. In order to provide exactly what you want in your application, you must give up something to gain the other in a battery. The important battery parameters are given in the following image. . Now, let’s look into each battery parameter briefly to understand its importance and impact on battery performance during operation. . Rechargeable / Non-Rechargeable batteries . There might not be much confusion in choosing between a primary and secondary battery, you must only know if you want the battery to be used once or multiple times. The primary (Non-Rechargeable) battery can be used for occasional uses like toys, Flashlights, Smoke alarm, etc. They are also used in devices in which charging isn’t possible like pacemakers, wristwatches and hearing aids. The Secondary (rechargeable) batteries can be used in the applications where there is a need for a regular power source like mobile phones, laptops, Automotives, etc. The secondary batteries always have a higher self-discharge rate compared to primary batteries which are an ignorant fact due to its ability to be recharged. . Availability of Space . The Batteries are available in various shapes and size like button cells, cylindrical cells, Pouch cells &amp; prismatic cells. The size of the battery really matters in order to make your device easily portable. The standard sizes available are AA, AAA and 9V batteries suitable for portable devices. Commonly lithium batteries (pouch type) are preferred in applications where there is less space but more power requirement. If the power requirement is less then coin cells can also be considered since they are very compact and the smallest of battery types. . Different Shapes of Battery . System Operating Voltage . The battery voltage is one of the most important characteristics of the battery, which is determined based on the electrode &amp; electrolyte used (Chemical Reaction). There is a common misconception that a fully discharged battery will have 0V it is clearly not the case in any battery. In fact, if a battery reads 0V then it probably is dead. The output voltage of a battery should always read between its nominal voltage level. . The Zinc-Carbon battery and Nickel-metal hydride battery uses water as an electrolyte and delivers a nominal voltage of 1.2V to 2V, whereas the lithium-based batteries use organic electrolytes that can deliver a nominal voltage of 3.2 to 4V. Most of the electronic pieces of equipment operate in the voltage range of 3V. If you use a lithium-based battery a single cell battery will be enough to operate the equipment. Do remember that the voltage of the battery will not be stable and will vary between a minimum value and maximum value based on the available capacity in the battery. This minimum and maximum value of each battery is shown below. . Minimum and Maximum Value of Battery . If your circuit is operating at 5V and you are powering it with a lithium battery, then your nominal voltage will only be 3.2V to 4V. In these cases, boost converter circuits are used to convert the battery voltage to 5V required for the circuit. If your operating voltage is very high like 24V or 12V then you can either use a 12V lead-acid battery or if you need high power density then you can combine more than one lithium cells in series to increase the resulting output voltage. . Operating Temperature . The battery performance can be dramatically changed by the temperature, for instance the battery that is operating with aqueous electrolytes cannot be used in temperature conditions below 0°C as they aqueous electrolyte might get frozen under 0°C, in the same way, the lithium-based batteries might operate up to -40°C but the performance might be dropped. . Battery Performance . The lithium-ion batteries have the maximum charging rate between the temperature ranges of about 20°C to 45°C. If you want to charge beyond this temperature range lower current/voltage need to be used, this will result in longer charging time. If the temperature drops below 5°C or 10°C lithium dendrite plating will be formed in the electrolyte which needs to be prevented by trickle charge. . Capacity of the battery - Power &amp; Energy . The power of the battery determines the runtime of a battery. The power/Capacity of the battery is expressed in Watt-hours (Wh). The Watt-hour is calculated by multiplying the battery voltage (V) by the amount of current that a battery can deliver for a certain amount of time. The voltage of the battery is almost fixed and the current that a battery can deliver is printed on the battery, expressed in Ampere-hour rating (Ah or mAh). . Consider a battery of 5V with 2 Amp-hour (Ah) capacity, hence it has a power of 10Wh. A battery with the capacity of 2Ah can deliver 2 Amp for one hour or 0.2A for 10 hours or 0.02A (20mA) for 100 hours. Battery manufacturers always specify the capacity at a given discharge rate, temperature, and cut-off voltage, where the capacity always depends on all three factors. . The capacity of a battery will tell us how much power it can deliver to an application. For example, consider a 12V, 10Ah car battery, the actual capacity of the battery is 120Wh (12V x 10Ah), but in a laptop battery of 3.6V that has the same 10Ah dissipation will have a capacity of 36Wh (3.6Vx 10Ah). From the example you can see even they have the same Ah the amount of power that a car battery can store is three times higher than a laptop battery. . The following picture will give you more clarity about how the battery capacity differs in different types of batteries. . Capacity of Batteries . Batteries with high power always provide a faster discharge capability at high drain rates like power tools or automobile starter battery applications, most of the high power batteries will have a low energy density. . Battery Chemistry . By this time you would have understood that all the properties of a battery are always depending on the chemistry involved in the battery, so you should be more conscious while you choose the type of battery. On the basis of the chemistry involved in the operation, batteries are classified as Lead Acid Batteries, Alkaline Batteries, Ni-Cad Batteries (Nickel Cadmium), Ni- MH Batteries (Nickel Metal Hydride), Li-Ion (Lithium-Ion) and LiPoly (Lithium Polymer) Batteries . Different types of Battery . Cost of Battery . In most portable electronics products the battery will be one among the expensive item in the Bill of Materials (BOM), hence most of the time it will affect the overall cost of your electronic applications. Hence, you should know your needs and budget of your product and then choose the right battery for your product. . Shelf Life . Not all the batteries are used immediately after manufacturing, they stay on the shelf for a long time before it’s being used. The shelf life of a battery tells you how long a battery can be kept unused. The Shelf life is mostly considered as a fact in primary batteries only as the secondary batteries can be recharged whenever they are used. For example in a fire alarm siren system, the battery might sit there idle for years before it detects a fire and triggers the alarm. So care should be taken that the battery retains its performance even if it is kept unused for a long time. . Which battery should I choose? . Now that we have looked into the parameters you should consider before choosing the battery for a portable electronic application, let’s look into the common cases of choosing the battery. Note that these are just tips and not hard written rules. . For products that consume more power like projectors, large sound systems, and motorized projects you should use lead-acid batteries. If you are going to have heavy usage of the battery you should go for ‘Marine deep cycle’ batteries. | If your electronics need to be super small like an inch on each side you should go for the lithium coin cells or little lithium polymer cells. | If you are going to produce the component in large quantity use inexpensive alkaline batteries of popular sizes. So the customer finds it easy to replace them. | If you want the device to be user-serviceable, like the users can change the battery by themselves go for 9V or AA-size batteries. | Use 3 Alkaline (4.5V) or 4NiMH cells (4.8V) if the circuit needs approximately 5V input. | To build a rechargeable battery pack use a battery holder from your local shop and stick it with NiMH batteries and then start recharging your battery. | If you want to replace your alkaline battery with any of the rechargeable batteries, test your device to make sure that it can operate at lower voltage without any issue. | If you want your battery to have a longer life span always use a high-quality charger with sensors to maintain proper charging and trickle charging because using a cheap charger will kill off your cells in the battery pack. | .",

            "title": "How to Choose Motors",
            "content": "How Motors Work and How to Choose the Right Motor . Motors can be found practically everywhere. This guide will help you learn the basics of electric motors, available types and how to choose the correct motor. The basic questions to answer while deciding which motor is most appropriate for an application are which type should I choose and which specifications matter. . How do motors work? . Electric motors work by converting electrical energy to mechanical energy in order to create motion. Force is generated within the motor through the interaction between a magnetic field and winding alternating (AC) or direct (DC) current. As the strength of a current increases so does the strength of the magnetic field. Keep Ohm’s law (V = I*R) in mind; voltage must increase in order to maintain the same current as resistance increases. . Electric Motors have an array of applications. Conventional industrial uses include blowers, machine and power tools, fans and pumps. Hobbyists generally use motors in smaller applications requiring movement such as robotics or modules with wheels. Types of motors: There are many types of DC motors, but the most common are brushed or brushless. There are also vibrating motors, stepper motors, and servo motors. . DC Brush Motors . DC brush motors are one of the most simple and are found in many appliances, toys, and automobiles. They use contact brushes that connect with a commutator to alter current direction. They are inexpensive to produce and simple to control and have excellent torque at low speeds (measured in revolutions per minute or RPM). A few downsides are that they require constant maintenance to replace worn out brushes, have limited in speed due to brush heating, and can generate electromagnetic noise from brush arcing. . Brushless DC Motors . Brushless DC motors use permanent magnets in their rotor assembly. They are popular in the hobby market for aircraft and ground vehicle applications. They are more efficient, require less maintenance, generate less noise, and have higher power density than brushed DC motors. They can also be mass-produced and resemble an AC motor with a constant RPM, except powered by DC current. There are a few disadvantages however, which include that they are difficult to control without a specialized regulator and they require low starting loads and specialized gearboxes in drive applications causing them to have a higher capital cost, complexity, and environmental limitations. . Vibrating Motors . Vibrating motors are used for applications requiring vibration such as cell phones or game controllers. They are generated by an electric motor and have an unbalanced mass on the drive shaft which causes the vibration. They can also be used in non-electronic buzzers that vibrate for the purpose of sound or for alarms or door bells. . Stepper Motor . Whenever precise positioning is involved, stepper motors are your friend. They’re found in printers, machine tools, and process control systems and are built for high-holding torque that gives the user the ability to move from one step to the next. They have a controller system that designates the position through signal pulses sent to a driver, which interprets them and sends proportional voltage to the motor. They are relatively simple to make and control, but they draw maximum current constantly. Small step distance limits top speed and steps can be skipped at high loads. . Servo Motor . Servo motors are another popular hobby market motor and are used for position control without precision. Their popular applications include remote control applications like RC toy vehicles and robotics. They consist of a motor, potentiometer, and a control circuit and are mostly controlled through pulse width modulation (PWM), through the sending of electrical pulses to the control wire. Servos can be either AC or DC. AC servos can handle higher current surges and are used for industrial machinery, whereas DC servos are for smaller hobbyist applications. To learn more about servos check out our How Servo Motors Work article. . AC Motors . There are three basic types of AC motors: induction, synchronous, and industrial. . Induction Motor . Induction motors are referred to as asynchronous motors, since they do not move at the same constant rate or turn slower than the frequency supplied. Slip, the difference between actual and synchronous speed, is needed to produce torque, the twisting force that causes rotation, in induction motors. The magnetic field that surrounds the rotor of these motors is caused by induced current. . Synchronus Motor . The rotor of synchronous motors spins at a constant rate as AC is supplied. Their magnetic field is created by permanent magnets. Industrial motors are designed for three-phase, high power applications such as conveyers or blowers. AC motors can also be found in home appliances and other applications such as clocks, fans, and disk drives. . What to consider when purchasing a motor: . There are several characteristics that you need pay attention to when selecting a motor but voltage, current, torque, and velocity (RPM) are most important. . Current is what powers the motor and too much current will damage the motor. For DC motors, operating and stall current are important. Operating current is the average amount of current the motor is expected to draw under typical torque. Stall current applies enough torque for the motor to run at stall speed, or 0RPM. This is the maximum amount of current the motor should be able to draw, as well as the maximum power when multiplied by the rated voltage. Heat sinks are important are constantly running the motor or are running it at higher than the rated voltage in order to keep the coils from melting. . | Voltage is used to keep net current flowing in one direction and to overcome back current. The higher the voltage, the higher the torque. The voltage rating of a DC motor indicates the most efficient voltage while running. Be sure to apply the recommended voltage. If you apply too few volts, the motor will not work, whereas too many volts can short windings resulting in power loss or complete destruction. . | Operating and stall values also need to be considered with torque. Operating torque is the amount of torque the motor was designed to give and stall torque is the amount of torque produced when power is applied from stall speed. You should always look at the required operating torque, but some applications will require you to know how far you can push the motor. For example, with a wheeled robot, good torque equals good acceleration but you must make sure the stall torque is strong enough to lift the weight of the robot. In this instance, torque is more important than speed. . | Velocity, or speed (RPM), can be complex regarding motors. The general rule is that motors run most efficiently at the highest speeds but it is not always possible if gearing is required. Adding gears will reduce the efficiency of the motor, so take into account speed and torque reduction as well. . | . These are the basics to consider while selecting a motor. Consider an application’s purpose and which current it uses to select the appropriate type of motor. An application’s specifications such as voltage, current, torque, and velocity will determine which motor is most appropriate so be sure to pay attention to its requirements. .",
